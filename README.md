# Theory of Algorithms Project 

Name: Matthew Sloyan
Student ID: G00348036

# Project statement
You must write a program in the C programming language [2] that calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Request For Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force [5]. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm — you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on. I suggest you allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the command line.

# Platforms
Coded and tested on a Linux Debian 10 (buster) Google Cloud Virtual Machine. All code was written in VI and compiled by connecting to the VM using SSH.

# How to run program
* First, clone the repository using the following command `git clone https://github.com/MatthewSloyan/MD5-message-digest-algorithmt` 
* Traverse using the command line to the folder you have cloned using the cd command.
* Compile main.c file to execute using gcc -o main main.c
* Execute file using ./main

# User Guide
Below you’ll find a basic guide to the user interface, in the “How it works” section is a description of how this works in the code behind.

* You will be presented with a menu..

# How it works
More information on each of these steps above can be found in the Research & Development Diary section below.

# Project Plan
* Week 1 - Initial research and setup.
* Week 2 - Setup Google Cloud VM and learn VI.
* Week 3 - Write basic menu and file writing functions.
* Week 4 - Start to implement the MD5 algorithm.
* Week 5 - Continue implementation.
* Week 6 - Continue implementation.
* Week 7 - Improve and test implementation.
* Week 8 - Adding finishing touches, tidying up code, and adding extras.

# Research & Development Diary

#### Start of Semester to 26-1-20
Each week I watched the various videos posted on Moodle and read into more about each topic such as Hash Functions, Turing Machines, SHA and MD5 standard. I also researched online more about C and working with VI as we haven’t worked with this in a little while. This has really helped me with this project and will be a valuable skill going forward in my career. 

#### Week of 26-1-20 to 2-2-20
From the project spec I realised the project would need an interface with the ability to read a file, so I decided to implement this in C which I would use down the line to implement the MD5 algorithm with. Also, using the videos supplied on Moodle, I setup the Google Virtual Machine and coded some basic test programs using VI in Python and C. 

#### Week of 2-2-20 to 9-2-20
